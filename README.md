<h2>Bio</h2>
A 200 word statement that answers the following questions:
• What is your major and year?
• What is your specific research interest/area of specialization within the digital humanities? What
research program would you like to undertake in the field?
• How are your existing projects reflective of this emphasis? How have you already demonstrated
expertise in your stated specialization?
• Where will you take this work in the future? (Assume you will continue to do research within the digital
humanities, even if this is not the case)
Here is a short list of areas of specialization: critical infrastructure studies, geospatial analysis, data
visualization, text analysis, algorithmic criticism, media archaeology, cultural studies, built media
scholarship, and open access publishing. You are by no means restricted to this list when choosing a
specialization

<h2>Featured Project</h2>
<h3>"Nintendo's Virtual Boy"</h3>
Choose one of your two most recent projects (research presentation or academic blog) and revise it
based on instructor feedback. Under the featured project heading on the homepage, you should include
the following elements:
• At least one visually attractive image to headline the section
• The title of your project
• A 250 word abstract introducing the work: it’s main argument (thesis), approach or methodology,
research findings, and significance within the field.
• A 250 word statement describing how this research evolved over time. This statement should describe
the revisions you made to the existing work based on instructor feedback. It should also explain how
your understanding of the field evolved based on the work undertaken.
• A link to the project, which is now updated in the manner you’ve described (this will be one of the same
links used for your three projects below).
* If you wish to revise your collaborative project for the featured project, you will need instructor
permission to do so.
** If you wish to revise the research presentation and would like additional instructor feedback, you may
consult with me during our final class.
*** Revisions should be substantial and meaningful. Referencing your revisions by pointing to your
commit history in GitHub would be an excellent strategy
