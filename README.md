<p> Hello, my name is Nicole Boccia and I am in my second year at Brock University majoring in the Interactive Arts and Sciences program. My interests of spcializations within the digital humanitites include data visualization, cultural studies, and digital expression. My existing projects such as the collaborative project, research presentation, and academic blog post all reflect these specializations. For example the Collaborative project reflects data visualization because how your website looks all depends on what data is put in the tool. The Academic Blog Post reflects cultural studies because of how and why genres evolve or go out of style over time. The Research Presentation reflects digital expression, data visualization, and cultural studies because coding controls the output of the project, and the topic of virtual reality and how it is protrayed is constantly changing.</p>
<p>In the future I will use these projects as inspirations for other projects. For example I can come back to these projects use the coding or format, then add on or change accordinly. In the future I can also use these projects as a comparison. For example I can compare future projects to these to show how I have improved, and what tools I have used.

<h2>Featured Project</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This is a project about Nintendo's Virtual Boy. It talks about the product, virtual reality, and how they have changed over time. This projects main arguement is that the Nintendo Boy failed because it was too ahead of its time. There was not enough money to make it, or the right technology out to fully show the concept of virtual reality. From it's failure Nintendo decided not to release any more headsets and the next closest thing to 3D was the 3Ds and was a huge sucess. Another main arguement from this project is that virtual reality can be used for more than just games. It can be used for simulations, training, safety, health, and much more. Virtual reality is significant in the field of the digital humanitites because it was a futuristic concept brought to life by a variety of tools. This technology is being used in more ways then it was intended for, and new ways of use are always being found. Looking back at products like Virtual Boy gives an unusual feeling because they look cheesy, cheap, and have terrible graphics, yet this is how it started. The Virtual Boy was just a cheap headset with red leds costing $180 or more, and a limited amount of games. Now we have products like the Oculus Rift that can be used as a comparison of how graphics, quality, technology, and avaliability have changed. The concept of virtual reality makes more sense now that it can actually be shown.

<h3>Research Process</h3>

<p>This research evolved over time by including a project, and concepts that inspired Virtual Reality. The feedback for the project was, "Great slides!More engaged media archaeological work would take this up a notch". I tried to achieve this by adding in some facts as to when the concept of virtual reality started, but was it not reffered to as VR. I added two slides/sections to my GitHub page that included facts such as when the concept of VR first started. The concept is said to be traced back to the 1860's. One of the first concepts of VR was reffered to as Simulation, putting yourself in a situation and manipulating your way around. The example I used was an early flight simulation device developed in the 1920's by Edwin Link. It was a training device for new pilots. I also modified the other slides to lead into one another and edited the conclusion to include the new research. With the new research, and modifications my understanding of VR has expanded. Before modifying this project I thought the concept of VR was fairly new and started around 1960's. When I found out about the flight simulator it completely changed my perspective because I thought this concept was based around televsion, the idea of emerging yourself in something fiction or non-fiction.
