<p> Hello, my name is Nicole Boccia and I am in my second year at Brock University majoring in the Interactive Arts and Sciences program. My interests of spcializations within the digital humanitites include data visualization, cultural studies, and digital expression. My existing projects such as the collaborative project, research presentation, and academic blog post all reflect these specializations. For example the Collaborative project reflects data visualization because how your website looks all depends on what data is put in the tool. The Academic Blog Post reflects cultural studies because of how and why genres evolve or go out of style over time. The Research Presentation reflects digital expression, data visualization, and cultural studies because coding controls the output of the project, and the topic of virtual reality and how it is protrayed is constantly changing.</p>
<p>In the future I will use these projects as inspirations for other projects. For example I can come back to these projects use the coding or format, then add on or change accordinly. In the future I can also use these projects as a comparison. For example I can compare future projects to these to show how I have improved, and what tools I have used.
<h2>Featured Project</h2>
<h3>"Nintendo's Virtual Boy"</h3>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
• A 250 word abstract introducing the work: it’s main argument (thesis), approach or methodology,
research findings, and significance within the field.
<h3>Research Process</h3>
• A 250 word statement describing how this research evolved over time. This statement should describe
the revisions you made to the existing work based on instructor feedback. It should also explain how
your understanding of the field evolved based on the work undertaken.
• A link to the project, which is now updated in the manner you’ve described (this will be one of the same
links used for your three projects below).
* If you wish to revise your collaborative project for the featured project, you will need instructor
permission to do so.
** If you wish to revise the research presentation and would like additional instructor feedback, you may
consult with me during our final class.
*** Revisions should be substantial and meaningful. Referencing your revisions by pointing to your
commit history in GitHub would be an excellent strategy
